COLOSSTEAM takes on a mix of steampunk and high fantasy tropes. Played through the view of a 2D side-scroller like "Dead Cells", the game explores a diverse world of unique sci-fi society. Players can find themselves in a dark, harrowing slums filled with black magic and unnatural creations. Or they can find themselves sailing on the deck of a magic airship through the clouds.

## Game Play

### Mechanics

*   Ratio Reward Schedules: Defeating enough enemies in a window of time to gain a temporary boost.

### New user experience

Basic controls will be presented in pre-scripted events with text fields opening up to instruct players of controls gradually.
