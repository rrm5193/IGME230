COLOSSTEAM takes on a mix of steampunk and high fantasy tropes. Played through the view of a 2D side-scroller like "Dead Cells", the game explores a diverse world of unique sci-fi society. Players can find themselves in a dark, harrowing slums filled with black magic and unnatural creations. Or they can find themselves sailing on the deck of a magic airship through the clouds.

Game Play

*   Ratio Reward Schedules: Defeating enough enemies in a window of time to gain a temporary boost.

### Control

*   WASD keys to move

### New user experience

Basic controls will be presented in pre-scripted events with text fields opening up to instruct players of controls gradually.

Player learning will be prompted with visual queues to indicate whether or not the action taken was the correct choice or not. For instance an enemy weak to lightning damage would flash red to indicate so.
